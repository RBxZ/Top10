# Top10
An in-progress social media app using android studio with Java, and a python server with MongoDB data base.

This is a social media app, like Instagram, only it is based on TOP10 lists, and not just photos. 
The users, once signed up, can log in to their acount, add lists to their page, see their friedns lists, comment on them and also explore new lists that are suggested by the app.
All the data is transfered to a python server using Base64 encryption, which decodes the data and then determains what to do with it.
At the end of the process, the server uploads the data to a MongoDB database using PyMongo.

The app is still in-progress, meaning not all the features are finished, but the main frame is finished.
